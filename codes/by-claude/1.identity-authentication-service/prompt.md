## 🎯 **SINGLE MASTER PROMPT:**

```
🔒 MANDATORY TECH STACK: TypeScript + NestJS + React + PostgreSQL + Prisma (NO JAVA/SPRING BOOT)

TASK: Implement Sub-Project 1: Identity & Authentication + Unified Portal

ARCHITECTURE: Follow EMSA-v1.0 standard exactly

DOCUMENTATION:
📚 SRS-Grok-v2.md (complete specifications)
📋 sub-project-1-identity-auth-complete.md (file mapping + implementation guide)  
🏗️ EMSA-v1-standard-architecture.md (architecture standard)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Read the docs, check the mapping table, implement according to SRS specs.
Start with project setup, then work through the features systematically.

FORBIDDEN: Java, Spring Boot, C#, PHP, Python backends
REQUIRED: Confirm TypeScript + NestJS before starting
```

## 💡 **WHY THIS WORKS:**

**Tech Pro Mindset:**
- ✅ "Give me docs + standards → I'll figure it out"  
- ✅ "Mapping table shows what files → I know the scope"
- ✅ "SRS has interfaces → I implement exact contracts"
- ❌ "Don't micromanage me with step-by-step instructions"

**AI Agent = Tech Pro:**
- **Smart enough** to read documentation
- **Experienced enough** to follow architecture patterns  
- **Professional enough** to implement clean code
- **Just needs** clear boundaries and good documentation

## 🎯 **FINAL ANSWER:**

**SINGLE UNIVERSAL PROMPT:**
```
🔒 TECH STACK: TypeScript + NestJS + React + Prisma (NO JAVA)

Implement Sub-Project 1 following EMSA-v1.0 architecture.

Docs: SRS-Grok-v2.md + mapping table + EMSA standard

Read docs → check mapping → implement according to specs.

Confirm TypeScript + NestJS first.
```

**Attachment:** 3 files (SRS + mapping + EMSA)

**Done! 🚀 Simple, clean, professional!**
